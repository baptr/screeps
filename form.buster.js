// Maintain an attack formation:
// d = dismantler
// h = healer
// r = ranged
//
//   d d d
// r r h r r
// r r r r r
//    ~h~
// where the edges can all fall off if needed.
// probably pre-scout the destination, and spawn as appropriate
//
// also figure out the right targets to attack to break through the weakest defense
// maybe cost=50-100 scaled by hits for walls and ramparts?
// though more adjacent spots to attack from is probably also useful...
